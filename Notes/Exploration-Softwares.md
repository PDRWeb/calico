## **3. Automation & Workflow Example**

### **Daily Workflow Example**
1. **Lightspeed records sales & inventory changes.**  
2. **Homebase pulls sales data** → Auto-adjusts labor schedule.  
3. **Smartsheet updates sales & labor reports** for management.  
4. **Slite sends reminders** for team SOP reviews based on updates.  
5. **Tally collects feedback** from employees & customers → Updates Smartsheet.

## **4. Potential Gaps & Solutions**
| **Gap** | **Potential Solution** |
|---------|------------------------|
| No direct Smartsheet ↔ Lightspeed integration | Use Zapier or API to push sales/inventory data. |
| No Homebase ↔ Slite connection | Use Smartsheet as an intermediary for tracking SOP compliance. |
| Manual form submissions (Tally) | Automate form responses using Smartsheet triggers. |
| No built-in financial reporting in Lightspeed | Use Smartsheet to consolidate financial tracking. |

## **5. Recommended Reporting & Dashboards**
- **Sales & Inventory Dashboard (Smartsheet)**: Pulls Lightspeed data for trends.  
- **Labor vs. Sales Report (Homebase → Smartsheet)**: Tracks scheduling efficiency.  
- **Procedure Compliance (Slite → Smartsheet)**: Monitors team adherence to SOPs.  
- **Customer & Employee Satisfaction (Tally → Smartsheet)**: Tracks feedback.  

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- **Smartsheet acts as the central hub** for reporting & tracking.  
- **Automation tools like Zapier & APIs** help bridge gaps.  
- **Slite ensures documentation is structured & updated.**  
- **Homebase optimizes staffing based on real-time sales.**  
- **Tally captures feedback for operational improvement.**
